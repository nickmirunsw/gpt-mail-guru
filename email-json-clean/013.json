Congratulations everyone, the buzz around the business on this sprint is exciting.\nWith only two weeks remaining, we’ve seen some big shifts in the leaderboard. Awesome effort by Brendan Drzezdzon who jumped right up, following some intensive BD activity with Lisa Houston – more on that below.\nAlong with this weeks’ individual leaderboard I've also included the Top 5 clients engaged within our Client Program.\nINDIVIDUAL LEADERBOARD\n158\nPhilip Massey – P&B\n143\nBrendan Drzezdzon – M&M\n86\nMichelle Brownlie – P&B\n85\nMatthew Salisbury – P&B\n84\nChristophe Kowalczyk – TPT\n60\nLisa Houston – M&M\n57\nDirk Smith – M&M\n55\nBenjamin Carr – P&B\n43\nDavid Sulejic – Advisory\n37\nBen Jensen – Advisory\nTOP 5 ENGAGED CLIENTS\n1.\nBHP\n2.\nQLD Transport & Main Roads portfolio\n3.\nTransport for NSW portfolio\n4.\nRio Tinto\n5.\nVic Transport portfolio\nYou still have time to make an impact!

They visited five sites including BMA Goonyella, Saraji, Saraji South, Peak Downs, and Peabody Coppabella focusing on coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP) projects, and met with over 50 clients.\nLisa and Brendan now have a series of tasks and opportunities to address before embarking on another tour in six weeks' time. Key opportunities identified as a result of this trip includes a 3M conveyor replacement at BMA Goonyella Riverside Mine, a structural check of microcells at BMA Saraji Mine, enabling works at BMA Saraji South and 9M rejects upgrade at BMA Peak Downs Mine.\nThis is a great example of targeted client engagement resulting in strong relationships, specific client insights and actions to improve our position, and ultimately new opportunities and projects.\nWay to go Lisa and Brendan!\nKnow WSP to Grow WSP\nTo provide the best service to our clients, we must continue to develop our WSP knowledge and networks.

These will serve as base drafts, with further details to be added as the design progresses. It’s important that we get these base versions completed within a reasonable timeframe (i.e. 2–3 days).\nWhile these drawings may be subject to updates following the alignment review, it's critical that we get started as soon as possible.\n@Lovett, Nathan\n– please ensure the drawings are set up using Xrefs to minimise rework when changes occur.\n@Christine, Yoshe\n– can you please upload the new sheets to the Bluebeam session and provide drawing numbers as needed. An advanced copy is also attached for reference.\nPlease confirm if the requested timeframe is achievable. If anything is unclear, don’t hesitate to reach out.\nThanks,\nNick\nNick Mirsepassi\nTunnel Engineer/Data Scientist\nNick.Mirsepassi@wsp.com\nWSP Australia Pty Limited\nLevel 27, 680 George Street\nSydney, 2000\nAustralia\nwsp.com/en-au\nWSP acknowledges that every project we work on takes place on First Peoples lands.

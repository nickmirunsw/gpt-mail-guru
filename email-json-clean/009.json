We’ve launched from strong foundations, so let’s keep this momentum going before a well-deserved Easter break.\nYou’ve heard it from me and our leadership team—at a time when our markets are more challenging than they have been in the past, we all need to remain focused on staying close to our\nclients\n. With our strategy and brand refresh, we’re committed to deepening client partnerships and working as one WSP to win and deliver more work.\nLast week’s\nfederal budget brought some positive signs\n, especially in mining and energy, which are central to our strategy. Check out our budget breakdown\nhere\nto help with client conversations and media commentary from Paul, Managing Director of Mining & Metals\nhere\nand Charlie, Managing Director of Water, Power & Energy\nhere\n. Additionally, the Queensland Government delivered their 100 Day Review outcome, setting the plan for the Olympic Games. Queensland is now ready to deliver, opening up opportunities for us across all disciplines to create a lasting legacy.\nIt’s been great to see your competitive spirit through our\nClient Engagement Sprint\n—we're over halfway, so still plenty of time to top the leader board. In the last few weeks, I’ve spent time with clients in Adelaide, Canberra and Sydney and this week in Perth. As mentioned, our markets are challenging but I feel optimistic about the opportunities for WSP, and we have won some really good work in the last few weeks. But a consistent theme from clients is the need for the industry to do more with less, especially when budgets are constrained. Many are looking for minimum viable product outcomes. A simple but important message. Next week, I’ll be in Melbourne and will be meeting more clients and our Melbourne colleagues at morning tea—I look forward to seeing some of you then.\nLast week, our\nAustralian Defence team\n, led by Phil Massey,\nhosted a global delegation of WSP Defence experts\nfor an incredible week of technical presentations and client engagement on AUKUS. This included WSP’s 7th Annual Defence Conference in Canberra, which I attended along with Rob Clarke, our Managing Director for Property & Buildings. I was blown away by the WSP capability we were also to demonstrate. These client events are key to our\nAustralia Activation Plan\nfor the next three years.\nWe’ve seen some\ngreat success with several strategic project pursuits across the business\nrecently.\nIn a great display of ‘One WSP’, our Advisory team – with support from our Transport and Earth & Environment business groups – have secured a strategic package of work in South Australia to help the State Government bring decarbonised public transport network a step closer. This will involve development of the business case to plan towards a transition to zero emission operations across bus networks in the state.\nClick here\nto view more about this ‘ring the bell’ moment.\nWe’re also Preferred and in final stages of contract negotiations on a number of key strategic opportunities including Faster Rail in Logan and Gold Coast and a new water delivery model in South East Queensland. Congratulations to all of the teams involved. These strategic wins will help to deliver the critical growth needed across the business, however, there is still more to be done.\nNone of this is possible without our people. A shout out to our\nGlobal Awards finalists from Australia\n. Good luck, and winners are expected to be announced in June at the Global Leadership Conference.\nWith Easter around the corner, I thought it’s timely to plant an Easter egg in this email. To see who has been paying the most attention to strategy from our recent\nWSP Live\n, the first to tell me what Alexandre L'Heureux, our President and Chief Executive Officer, said he was most pleased with during WSP’s last strategic cycle gets a prize.\nCheers,\nGreg\nCanopy\nWSP.com\nWSP Australia Pty Limited, Level 27, 680 George St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia\nThis email was sent to\nNick.Mirsepassi@wsp.com\nfrom\ngreg.kane@au.wsp.com\nReceive in Plain Text"
